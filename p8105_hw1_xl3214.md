# Question 1

First let’s load the dataset and take a look at what variables are
contained in the dataset.

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The dataset contains variables origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour.

The dataset has 358 observations and 15 variables.

The mean of variable `temperature` is 39.5821229.

Using temperature as dependent variable (Y) and time_hour as independent
variable (X), the dataset can be presented in the following scatterplot:

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, 
       aes(x = time_hour, 
           y = temp, 
           colour = humid
          )
       ) + geom_point()
```

Based on the graph, it seems like temperature fluctuates frequently as
time_hour increases, but overall there seems to be an increasing trend.
As time_hour and temperature increases, it seems like humidity also
increases.

Next, I am saving the plot to my project directory using ggsave.

``` r
ggsave( filename = "scatter_time_temp.png", 
        plot = last_plot(), 
        device = "png", 
        path = NULL, 
        scale = 1, 
        width = NA, 
        height = NA, 
        units = c("in", "cm", "mm", "px")
      )
```

# Question 2

Create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df_question2 = 
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    log_vec = samp > 0,
    cha_vec = c("I", "don't", "know", "how", "to", "name", "entries", "in", "this", "vector"),
    fac_vec = factor(c("yes","no","unknown","yes","yes","no","no","no","yes","yes"))
  )
head(df_question2)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 4
    ##     samp log_vec cha_vec fac_vec
    ##    <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>   <fct>  
    ## 1  0.576 TRUE    I       yes    
    ## 2  0.634 TRUE    don't   no     
    ## 3 -1.44  FALSE   know    unknown
    ## 4  0.125 TRUE    how     yes    
    ## 5 -0.534 FALSE   to      yes    
    ## 6 -0.258 FALSE   name    no

- The mean of variable samp is -0.0885874.
- The mean of variable log_vec is 0.5.
- The mean of variable cha_vec is NA.
- The mean of variable fac_vec is NA.

Warning messages were given for computing mean of variable `cha_vec` and
`fac_vec`.
`Warning messages:1: In mean.default(pull(df_question2, cha_vec)): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA 2: In mean.default(pull(df_question2, fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA`

Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical,
character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the
output).

``` r
as.numeric(
  pull(df_question2, log_vec)
  )
as.numeric(
  pull(df_question2, cha_vec)
  )
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(
  pull(df_question2, fac_vec)
  )
```

In the output, warning message for cha_vec is generated, stating
`NAs introduced by coercion`. This is because characters are not
numbers, and cannot be converted to numeric variables. This helps
explain why the mean for `cha_vec` is NA. However, as.numeric was able
to turn `log_vec` into numeric variables by its levels.
